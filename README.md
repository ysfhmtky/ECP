# Exploit Code Generator (ECP)

**Exploit Code Generator** (ECP) is a Python tool designed to assist security researchers and penetration testers in quickly generating exploit code templates for common vulnerabilities. This tool provides a simple, interactive command-line interface to create templates for various types of exploits, including buffer overflow, command injection, SQL injection, XSS, reverse shell, DoS attack, and path traversal.

## Features

- **Buffer Overflow Exploit**
- **Command Injection Exploit**
- **SQL Injection Exploit**
- **XSS Exploit**
- **Reverse Shell Exploit**
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Exploit**
- **Path Traversal Exploit**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyfiglet` module (for ASCII banner display)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```
Usage
```
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
```
Run the script using Python:

```Copy code
python exploit_code_generator.py
```
Available Options
```
Once the script is running, you will be presented with a menu to choose the type of exploit you wish to generate. Each option corresponds to a specific exploit template. You will be prompted to enter required information such as target IP, port, payloads, or other necessary details.

Exploit Templates
Buffer Overflow Exploit
This template generates a buffer overflow exploit code where you can specify the target IP, port, buffer size, and return address.

Command Injection Exploit
This template generates code to perform a command injection attack by injecting a specified command into a vulnerable service.

SQL Injection Exploit
This template allows you to perform SQL injection on a target URL with a vulnerable parameter, executing the supplied SQL payload.

XSS Exploit
This template helps generate an XSS exploit to inject malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable site.

Reverse Shell Exploit
This template generates a reverse shell exploit, which connects the victim machine back to the attacker's machine and allows command execution.

Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Exploit
This template helps generate a simple DoS attack exploit by sending requests to a target server to overload it.

Path Traversal Exploit
This template allows path traversal by reading sensitive files on the target server, such as /etc/passwd.
